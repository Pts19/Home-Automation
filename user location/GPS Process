GPS Process
	Much more complicated than Wi-Fi to implement
	If we try, should use Google's Geolocation API instead - mix of GPS/Wi-Fi/Cell towers to be more accurate
		GPS doesn't work well indoors

[Option A] User's phone sends Geolocation to our RaspPi
	- Need to develop and install an app on the phone to ask permissions, send the data, etc.
	- Probably more like what we're imagining but this method might require too much work

	- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro

[Option B] Scrape the data from Google Maps Timeline
	- Not sure how often it updates though, might poll once a day or something and won't work
	- User needs Google Maps and Location History on

[Option C] Don't implement
	- Wi-fi is a good start
